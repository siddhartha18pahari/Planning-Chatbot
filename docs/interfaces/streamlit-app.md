# Streamlit Web Application

## Overview

The Planwise Streamlit web application provides an interactive, user-friendly interface for our recommendation system. Users can adjust preference sliders, chat with the recommender, view recommended places on a map, and provide feedback through ratings and reviews.

## Features

### User Authentication

- **Login/Signup**: Secure user authentication with username and password
- **Session Management**: Persistent user sessions with OAuth2 token-based authentication
- **Profile Management**: User preferences and reviews are saved and associated with user accounts

### Preference Input Methods

#### Interactive Sliders

Users can adjust preference sliders (0-5) across 29 categories including:
- Art galleries
- Museums
- Restaurants
- Parks
- Cafes
- And many more

The interface allows users to:
- Select which categories matter to them
- Specify preference strength for each category
- Save preferences for future sessions

#### Natural Language Chat

Users can express preferences conversationally:
- Type messages like "I love nature and museums but don't care for nightlife"
- The system extracts preferences from natural language
- Extracted preferences automatically update the sliders

### Recommendation Controls

- **Location Setting**: Users can specify their current location coordinates
- **Recommendation Method**: Choose between different algorithms:
  - Autoencoder-Based
  - SVD-Based
  - Transfer-Based
  - Embeddings-Based
  - Ensemble (combines all models)
- **Routing Profile**: Select between "foot-walking" and "driving-car" for route optimization

### Recommendation Visualization

Each recommended place shows:
- Name and icon
- Average rating
- User rating count
- Distance from user location
- Recommendation score

### User Feedback

- **Rating System**: Users can rate places on a 1-5 scale
